# Notes

## How to tell who's listening to who?

Example:
Consider you're looking at player 3. Their NN are 2 and 4.
We take Player number 3, and do correlation between the last half a second of 4 and 2.

Methodology:
1. We need to know the delay between them.
    - Note the delay changes over the experimental by $d(t) = 1/30 t$ (every 30 seconds, increase delay by 1 sec)
2. Determine coupling metrics $g$. Maximum number violins that they listen to.

## What if that doesn't work?
Prof. Fridman thinks we should use Deep Neural Networks for pitch classification

# Next meeting.

Try the statistical correlation. Next meeting date is in 2 weeks from now (Jun 28th ish)

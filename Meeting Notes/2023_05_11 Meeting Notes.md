# Notes
- For the summer, focus on software only. It would be too complicated to run through hardware while moving it around. Fridman will send the devices to me when I settle in NYC.

# Objective
- Look into https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.04332.pdf, see if we can extract this with analysis
- They're running the experiment on this, see if we can program dynamic decoupling etc. native on [Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software))
